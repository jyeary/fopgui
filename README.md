# fopgui
An example application using Apache FOP in a Swing UI. 

This project was originally written in 2006 using Java 5 and NetBeans 5.0. I was cleaning up code on my machine and found it. I decided to update it to Java 8 and Apache Maven. The original project used Apache ant and the dependencies were tied to the build machine. We thought that FOP would be the future to another project which would render PDF receipts to customers. This was a demo application to show how "easy" it was to use.
